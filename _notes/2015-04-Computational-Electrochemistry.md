Abstract:
We derive a mathematical model for the dynamics of redox reactions at an electrode-liquid interface when an external potential is applied to the electrode. The model couples chemical transport with electron kinetics and the set-up of the model allows for a general range of external potentials. We further investigate the resulting dynamics of five types of external potential. Numerical simulations are performed using a finite difference and a Chebyshev collocation approach yielding perfect agreement with theory whenever available.
