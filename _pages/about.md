Hi! I am a DPhil student in Applied Mathematics at the [Wolfson Centre for Mathematical Biology](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/mathematical-biology), part of the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk) of the University of Oxford. My research on __efficient stochastic simulation approaches for biochemical reaction networks__ is part of the <i><a href="https://www.iamruthbaker.com/">Quantitative Developmental Biology Group</a></i> led by Prof. [Ruth Baker](https://www.iamruthbaker.com/).

For more (academic) details, please see my [CV](/cv) or my [departmental website](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/casper.beentjes)
