abstract = {Many models of gene expression do not explicitly incorporate a cell cycle description. Here, we derive a theory describing how messenger RNA (mRNA) fluctuations for constitutive and bursty gene expression are influenced by stochasticity in the duration of the cell cycle and the timing of DNA replication. Analytical expressions for the moments show that omitting cell cycle duration introduces an error in the predicted mean number of mRNAs that is a monotonically decreasing function of $\eta$, which is proportional to the ratio of the mean cell cycle duration and the mRNA lifetime. By contrast, the error in the variance of the mRNA distribution is highest for intermediate values of $\eta$ consistent with genome-wide measurements in many organisms. Using eukaryotic cell data, we estimate the errors in the mean and variance to be at most 3{\%} and 25{\%}, respectively. Furthermore, we derive an accurate negative binomial mixture approximation to the mRNA distribution. This indicates that stochasticity in the cell cycle can introduce fluctuations in mRNA numbers that are similar to the effect of bursty transcription. Finally, we show that for real experimental data, disregarding cell cycle stochasticity can introduce errors in the inference of transcription rates larger than 10{\%}.},

abstract = {The bulk of stochastic gene expression models in the literature do not have an explicit description of the age of a cell within a generation and hence they cannot capture events such as cell division and DNA replication. Instead, many models incorporate cell cycle implicitly by assuming that dilution due to cell division can be described by an effective decay reaction with first-order kinetics. If it is further assumed that protein production occurs in bursts then the stationary protein distribution is a negative binomial. Here we seek to understand how accurate these implicit models are when compared with more detailed models of stochastic gene expression. We derive the exact stationary solution of the chemical master equation describing bursty protein dynamics, binomial partitioning at mitosis, age-dependent transcription dynamics including replication, and random interdivision times sampled from Erlang or more general distributions; the solution is different for single lineage and population snapshot settings. We show that protein distributions are well approximated by the solution of implicit models (a negative binomial) when the mean number of mRNAs produced per cycle is low and the cell cycle length variability is large. When these conditions are not met, the distributions are either almost bimodal or else display very flat regions near the mode and cannot be described by implicit models. We also show that for genes with low transcription rates, the size of protein noise has a strong dependence on the replication time, it is almost independent of cell cycle variability for lineage measurements and increases with cell cycle variability for population snapshot measurements. In contrast for large transcription rates, the size of protein noise is independent of replication time and increases with cell cycle variability for both lineage and population measurements.},

abstract = {Vitamin D deficiency is linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes such as pre-eclampsia (PET) but remains defined by serum measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) alone. To identify broader changes in vitamin D metabolism during normal and PET pregnancies we developed a relatively simple but fully parametrised mathematical model of the vitamin D metabolic pathway. The data used for parametrisation were serum vitamin D metabolites analysed for a cross-sectional group of women (n = 88); including normal pregnant women at 1 st (NP1, n = 25) and 3rd trimester (NP3, n = 21) and pregnant women with PET (n = 22), as well as non-pregnant female controls (n = 20). To account for the effects various metabolites have upon each other, data were analysed using an ordinary differential equation model of the vitamin D reaction network. Information obtained from the model was then also applied to serum vitamin D metabolome data (n = 50) obtained from a 2nd trimester pregnancy cohort, of which 25 prospectively developed PET. Statistical analysis of the data alone showed no significant difference between NP3 and PET for serum 25(OH)D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 concentrations. Conversely, a statistical analysis informed by the reaction network model revealed that a better indicator of PET is the ratios of vitamin D metabolites in late pregnancy. Assessing the potential predicative value, no significant difference between NP3 and PET cases at 15 weeks gestation was found. Mathematical modelling offers a novel strategy for defining the impact of vitamin D metabolism on human health. This is particularly relevant within the context of pregnancy, where major changes in vitamin D metabolism occur across gestation, and dysregulated metabolism is evidenced in women with established PET.},

abstract = {This work considers the method of uniformization for continuous-time Markov chains in the context of chemical reaction networks. Previous work in the literature has shown that uniformization can be beneficial in the context of time-inhomogeneous models, such as chemical reaction networks incorporating extrinsic noise. This paper lays focus on the understanding of uniformization from the viewpoint of sample paths of chemical reaction networks. In particular, an efficient pathwise stochastic simulation algorithm for time-homogeneous models is presented which is complexity-wise equal to Gillespie's direct method. This new approach therefore enlarges the class of problems for which the uniformization approach forms a computationally attractive choice. Furthermore, as a new application of the uniformization method, we provide a novel variance reduction method for (raw) moment estimators of chemical reaction networks based upon the combination of stratification and uniformization.},

abstract = {Quasi-Monte Carlo methods have proven to be effective extensions of traditional Monte Carlo methods in, amongst others, problems of quadrature and the sample path simulation of stochastic differential equations. By replacing the random number input stream in a simulation procedure by a low-discrepancy number input stream, variance reductions of several orders have been observed in financial applications. Analysis of stochastic effects in well-mixed chemical reaction networks often relies on sample path simulation using Monte Carlo methods, even though these methods suffer from typical slow {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}(N{\^{}}{\{}-1/2{\}}){\$} convergence rates as a function of the number of sample paths N. This paper investigates the combination of (randomised) quasi-Monte Carlo methods with an efficient sample path simulation procedure, namely {\$}{\$}$\backslash$tau{\$}{\$} -leaping. We show that this combination is often more effective than traditional Monte Carlo simulation in terms of the decay of statistical errors. The observed convergence rate behaviour is, however, non-trivial due to the discrete nature of the models of chemical reactions. We explain how this affects the performance of quasi-Monte Carlo methods by looking at a test problem in standard quadrature.},
